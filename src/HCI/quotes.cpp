   "Perhaps I\'m old and tired, but I think that the chances of finding out what\'s actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say, \"Hang the sense of it,\" and keep yourself busy. I\'d much rather be happy than right any day.\nAnd are you?\nAhh... No.",
   "Ahhh! Wooh! What\'s happening? Who am I? Why am I here? What\'s my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? Okay okay, calm down calm down get a grip now.",
   "And what\'s this thing coming toward me very fast? So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like \'Ow\', \'Ownge\', \'Round\', \'Ground\'! That\'s it! Ground! Ha! I wonder if it\'ll be friends with me? Hello, Ground!",
   "Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias, as it fell, was, \"Oh no, not again!\" Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly *why* the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now",
   "I must warn you, we\'re going to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing.\nWhat?\nIt may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me.",

   "You\'re looking for the Ultimate Question.\nYep.\nYou.\nMe.\nWhy?\nNo, I tried that: Why? 42. Doesn\'t work.",
   "You can blame the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation for making androids with GPP...\nUm... what\'s GPP?\nGenuine People Personalities. I\'m a personality prototype. You can tell, can\'t you...?",
   "The best drink in existance is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, the effect of which, is like having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick.",
   "The Encyclopedia Galactica, in its chapter on Love states that it is far too complicated to define. The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of love: Avoid, if at all possible. Unfortunately, Arthur Dent has never read the Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy.",
   "It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated. As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we\'ve just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure ongoing quality of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you.",
   "Do you know how much damage this bulldozer would sustain if I just let it roll over you?\nHow much?\nNone at all.",
   "The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the star-spangled banner, but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.",
   " Vogon poetry is the third worst in the Universe. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poetmaster, Grunthos the Flatulent, of his poem \"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\" four of his audience members died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. The absolute worst poetry in the universe was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex. Thankfully it was destroyed when the earth was.",
   "I checked The Guide for the best way to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere, it said \"don\'t\".",

   "I don\'t know what you\'re all worried about. Vogons are the worst marksmen in the galaxy.\n\nNow I\'ve got a headache.",
   "Vogons. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious, and callous. They wouldn\'t even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous Bug-Blatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, lost, found, queried, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighter. On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you.",

   "What to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue: Consider yourself lucky that life has been good to you so far.

   "Okay, don\'t think. Nobody think. No ideas. No theories. No nothing.",
   "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. More popular, certainly more successful than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty-Three More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid\'s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God\'s Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?",
   "Greetings. This is a recorded announcement as we are all out at the moment. The Commercial Council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at the tone.",

   "You know, it\'s at times like this, when I\'m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I\'d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\nWhy, what did she tell you?\nI don\'t know, I didn\'t listen.",

   "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools",
   "Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking.",

Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn\'t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."
